# MissCatboosts

The MissCatBoosts project, which employs CatBoost as its base learner, is a machine learning initiative that combines the CatBoost algorithm with techniques for handling missing values. CatBoost, an advanced machine learning library, is renowned for its efficiency, high accuracy, and excellent handling of categorical features. When CatBoost serves as the base learner in the MissCatBoosts project, it is able to effectively deal with missing values in datasets and provide more accurate prediction results.

The core idea of the MissCatBoosts project is to leverage the advantages of the CatBoost algorithm to impute missing values in datasets and then conduct model training and prediction based on the imputed data within the MICE missing value imputation framework. CatBoost's categorical feature support enables it to directly process non-numerical factors without requiring complex data transformation or preprocessing. This feature is particularly crucial when dealing with datasets containing a large number of categorical features.

In the MissCatBoosts project, CatBoost, as the base learner, will be responsible for handling missing values in datasets and capturing potential patterns in the data through its robust learning capabilities. Additionally, future plans for the project may include leveraging CatBoost's parallelization and distributed computing capabilities to accelerate the training process and improve model building efficiency.

In summary, the MissCatBoosts project, with CatBoost as its base learner, aims to leverage the strengths of the CatBoost algorithm to handle missing values in datasets and provide more accurate and efficient machine learning solutions. This project will provide valuable support to researchers and developers who need to process complex datasets and pursue high-precision prediction results.
